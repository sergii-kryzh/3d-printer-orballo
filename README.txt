Here are all files related to my 3D printer.
I've originally purchased Original Prusa MK2S kit.
But later found that frame was not stable enaugh.
So I've found this Spanish comapny: https://orballoprinting.com/en/
And purchased frame and many accessorised from them.
Here is a snapshot of a frame and a firmware from Orballo PRinting WEB site.


I greatly reccomend Orballo Printing!
